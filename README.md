# Bachelor
This is an online version of my bachelor project in which I will classify Harish-Chandra modules over the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. The project is still a work in progress and it should be finished sometime in June 2017. (So far I have only prepared the general layout of the paper, but this will also be changed later on.)
