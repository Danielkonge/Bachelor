# Bachelor
This is an online version of my bachelor project in which I will classify Harish-Chandra modules over sl(2,C) x sl(2,C) (or what is equivalent the complexification of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group). The project is still a work in progress and it should be finished sometime in June 2017.
